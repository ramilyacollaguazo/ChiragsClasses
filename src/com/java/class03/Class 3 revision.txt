Identifiers 

	what?	- It's user defined name to identify the class name, variable name & method name

	why? - We need to identify class, method, variable in java uniquly 

	Rules:

		1) Allow char 0-9, a-z, and $, _
		2) It's case sensitive 
		3) We can't use keywords
		4) it cannot start with digit 

		Valid   :  _a_, abc123, num_1
		invalid : 1num, num 1, num-1

DataTypes: 

	What?	- It's a type of data we want to store in a variable 

	Why?	- We need to specify which type of data we need to store in variable


	Data Types:
		Primitive 		Non Primitive
					
		byte			String
		short
		int 
		long
		float
		double
		char
		boolean

	Primitive	- It's a direct value 
	Non Primitive	- It's a object 

Variables:
	 
	What? - It's a container for storing the data. It's a reference to a memory where we're storing data

	Why?  - We need to store data during the program so variable will help to create container for that data

	1) Declaration of variable
		
		int num1;

	2) Assigning value to variable 

		num1 = 10;

	3) Declaration & initialization 

		int num1 = 10;
